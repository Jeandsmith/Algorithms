#Collection of Data Structure & Algorithms Implemented in Python

I workded on implemented theses textbook algorithms with the goal 
or having a refresher before and to work a bit more in my 
favorite language: Python.

I ran all of these experiments on a RYZE 5 3600 machine.

## Goal

My goal is to implement all the algorithms in the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by 
**Thomas H. Cormen**, **Charles E Leiserson**, **Ronald L. Rivest**, **Clifford Stein**.

So far I have implemented:

| Algo Name |
| --------- |
| Binary Search |
| Bubble Sort |
| Selection Sort |
| Linear Search |


## Bubble Sort

![run test]("Results/Bubblesort/Steps-per-run-of-N-elements-png.png")

This is a plot of the time the algorithm took to finish sorting a list of
elements ranging from 100 elements to 10k elements.

![run test]("Results/Bubblesort/figure.png")

The before and after of the array of 10K elements.
